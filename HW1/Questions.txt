1. Do Exercise: 2.5

2. Generate Fig. 2.3 and do Exercise 2.6. Repeat Fig. 2.3 for non-stationary. Explain what you see.

3. Exercise 2.7. Making constant step-size independent of Q_1, propose a method that does the above. Demonstrate using analysis.

4. Compare UCB to Optimistic Value and e-greedy for both Stationary & Non-Stationary case.
